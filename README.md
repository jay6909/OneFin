# OneFin
This repo will contain everything assignment related of onefin
Open readme.md file to see the assignment 1 link, I will upload the docx file in this repo as well in case the link doesn't work.
Also one more thing, I noticed the instructions given in the document mentioned when I perfom MOVIES API GET request I need to attach the token I recieved from login in movies api, but it was working even without the token. I attached the token,but that causes it to sometimes show 500 internal error, but trying again it says 200.
Just thought I should mention this.
Thank you!
